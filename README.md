# Running with Growtopia (Windows only)

## Desktop shortcut
If you would like to automatically run this script _only when you open Growtopia_, read on. Here's a guide on how to tie both Growtopia and growtopia-rpc into one useful shortcut:
- Note the following somewhere in reach:
+ The location of growtopia-rpc (Hint: double click on the address bar in Explorer to highlight the address)
+ The location of Growtopia (usually located in C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Growtopia)
- Next, make a shortcut from Growtopia.exe onto your desktop (in the directory up there) by right-clicking, going on "Send", and clicking "Desktop (create shortcut)"
- Now pull up Notepad and paste the following (make sure to change the Growtopia and growtopia-rpc directories appopriately to your setup using the notes above):

```
@echo off
cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\"
start /MIN "" "growtopia-discord-rpc.exe" ON_CLOSE_EXIT
cd "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Growtopia"
start Growtopia.exe
exit
```
- Hit `Ctrl+Shift+S`, choose "All Files" from the dropdown below, and save your batch file with a .bat extension, such as `growtopia-rpc.bat`
- Go to the shortcut you have created in step two, right click on it, and select "Properties"
- Replace the text in the "Target" section with the path to your batch (if you have it named `growtopia-rpc.bat` and it's on your desktop, it'll be something like `C:\Users\User\Desktop\growtopia-rpc.bat`)
- Press "Apply" and then press "Change Icon..."
- Press "OK" on the warning if there is one, and press "Browse". Now, paste the Growtopia directory address in the address bar. Choose Growtopia.exe, and then click on the icon
- Press "OK" again
- You're done. You can now use this shortcut to boot up both Growtopia and growtopia-rpc at once

## Windows start menu binding (optional)
To also automatically open this program when you launch Growtopia from the start menu, read on.
- Type "Growtopia" in the search bar
- Right click on the result, and click on "Open file location"
- Copy the shortcut you have created [in the tutorial above](#desktop-shortcut), then paste it in the Windows Explorer instance that you have opened in previous step (if prompted to replace the shortcut, click "Yes")
- You're done. Launching Growtopia from the start menu should now automatically open the Growtopia RPC program

# Running on startup (Windows only)

# Additional Notes

This script makes use of the data found in the `save.dat` file on your computer to be able to parse your GrowID as well as the world you're in.
This script does not use the `save.dat` file for purposes other than the ones mentioned above. The code has been made open-source for you to check for yourself.
